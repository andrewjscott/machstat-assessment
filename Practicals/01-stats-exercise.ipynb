Thus, the t-statistic is used to calculate a p-value, which is a measure of how unlikely the results would be were the null hypothesis to be true. A statistically significant p-value provides evidence that the samples we are using are so unlikely to have been gathered by chance were the null hypothesis true, which in turn provides a reason to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that the two groups are different.
